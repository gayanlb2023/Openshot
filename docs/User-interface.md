### Why this works

* **Pipe table** – GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) renders it automatically.  
* **Front-matter** – Jekyll builds the file as an HTML page with the default layout.  
* **No extra spaces** inside the `|` columns – that’s what breaks the table.

## Quick checklist (if the table still doesn’t appear)

| Check | How to fix |
|-------|------------|
| **Pages source** | Settings → Pages → **Branch: `main` (or `master`)**, **Folder: `/docs`** (or `/ (root)`). |
| **File location** | `docs/user-interface-overview.md` (or in the root if you chose `/`). |
| **Blank line before table** | There **must** be an empty line before the header row. |
| **No stray HTML** | Don’t wrap the table in `<table>` tags – let Markdown do the job. |
| **Cache** | Hard-refresh (`Ctrl + F5`) or open in an incognito window. |

# 2. User Interface Overview

Once you launch **OpenShot**, here's what you'll see:

| Area                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Main Toolbar**      | New project, save, import files, export, undo |
| **Function Tabs**     | Switch between Project Files, Transitions, Effects, and Emojis |
| **Project Files**     | Import videos, images, audio |
| **Preview Window**    | Playback of your project |
| **Timeline**          | Arrange clips in tracks (layers). This toolbar includes buttons for snapping, markers, slicing, jumping between markers, and centering the timeline |
| **Zoom Slider**       | This slider adjusts the timeline zoom. Drag edges to zoom in/out and the blue area to scroll. Clips and transitions appear as rectangles for context |
| **Play-head / Ruler** | The ruler shows the time-scale, and the red playhead marks the current position. Hold **Shift** while dragging to snap to nearby clips |
| **Timeline**          | The timeline shows your video project, including clips and transitions. Drag the mouse to select, move, or delete multiple items |
| **Filter**            | Use the buttons and filter box to search project files, transitions, effects, or emojis. Type a few letters to see matching results |
| **Playback** (Left to Right) | Jump to Start, Rewind, Play/Pause, Fast Forward, and Jump to End |
